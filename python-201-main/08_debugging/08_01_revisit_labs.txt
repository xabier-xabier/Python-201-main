Pick at least three labs and do them again while actively using a debugger.

Revisit the labs that you had a hard time completing.
Start them over from scratch without looking at the solution.

Use a visual debugger, such as the one integrated in your IDE or any
of the other options mentioned in the course to while writing the
code for these tasks.

This will give you a chance to revisit challenging tasks, as well as
to train using your debugger tool.
